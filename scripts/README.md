# Git History Generator

This script creates a realistic git working history for your project from June 20, 2025 to today.

## Features

- **Realistic Patterns**: More commits on weekdays, fewer on weekends
- **Varied Activity**: 2-8 commits on weekdays, 0-3 on weekends
- **Milestone Days**: Special days (June 20, 25, July 1) get 8-15 commits
- **Realistic Messages**: Uses conventional commit format with varied content
- **File Modifications**: Creates and modifies different files across the project

## Usage

### 1. Run the Script

```bash
./scripts/git-history-generator.sh
```

### 2. Push to GitHub

After the script completes, push the generated history:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## What It Does

1. **Initializes Git**: Creates a new repository if none exists
2. **Sets Remote**: Adds your GitHub repository as origin
3. **Generates Commits**: Creates commits for each day with realistic activity levels
4. **Creates Files**: Generates placeholder files in various directories
5. **Sets Dates**: Each commit gets the correct author and commit dates

## Activity Pattern

- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri)**: 2-8 commits per day
- **Weekends (Sat-Sun)**: 0-3 commits per day
- **Milestone Days**: 8-15 commits (June 20, 25, July 1)

## File Structure

The script creates files in these directories:
- `src/components/`
- `src/pages/`
- `src/services/`
- `src/store/`
- `src/utils/`
- `src/styles/`
- `src/contexts/`
- `src/hooks/`

## Commit Messages

Uses conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `refactor:` Code improvements
- `docs:` Documentation updates
- `style:` UI/styling changes
- `test:` Testing additions
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` Performance improvements

## Warning

‚ö†Ô∏è **This script rewrites git history!** 

- Make sure you have a backup
- Only use on new repositories or when you're sure about the changes
- The `--force` push will overwrite the remote repository

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change the date range
- Adjust commit frequency
- Add more milestone days
- Customize commit messages
- Modify file paths
